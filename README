First and foremost, I only tested this on Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu 10.4 x86/x64. If you find a problem let me know :)

If you don't have any deps installed, run this and go make some coffee:

sudo aptitude install python-setuptools python-dev gfortran-4.4 libjpeg62-dev libpng12-dev libfreetype6-dev \
libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsmpeg-dev libportmidi-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev g++ subversion

sudo easy_install pip virtualenv
virtualenv --no-site-packages fofix_env
source fofix_env/bin/activate
pip install -q numpy pyopengl PIL cython http://www.pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1release.tar.gz fofix-grisly-py26env.tar.bz2
pip install -qe svn+http://svn.jstump.com/r/oggstreamer/trunk/#egg=oggstreamer
FoFiX


To run it again later:
source fofix_env/bin/activate
FoFiX

If you already have all the python-deps and etc (from aptitude for example):

virtualenv fofix_env
source fofix_env/bin/activate
pip install -q fofix-grisly-py26env.tar.bz2
FoFiX


Notes:
1. src lives in fofix_env/lib/python2.6/site-packages/FoFiX/
2. fofix data dir is in fofix_env/share/fofix/
3. show which packages/versions are installed in your env with "pip freeze"
4. to leave the virtual_env use "deactivate"

Known issues:
1. FoFiX doesn't restart properly. This is an issue with my launcher script, not the game itself.
