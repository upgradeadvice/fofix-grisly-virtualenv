##@package VFS
# Functions providing a convenient virtual filesystem.
#
# Among other things, this is how themes and mods will be implemented.
# Note that *all* VFS functions use slash-delimited paths, relieving
# other code of the need to os.path.join().  All VFS paths must also
# be absolute (i.e. start with a slash) and may not contain "." or "..".
#
# Files or directories may be mounted in the root of the VFS read-only
# or read-write.  Mounting multiple things onto the same mountpoint
# overlays the newer mount's contents on the old mount's contents, but
# read-write mounts always prevail over read-only mounts in the resolution
# order.  All write attempts to a given mountpoint go to the most recent
# read-write mount on that mountpoint; trying to write to a mountpoint
# that has no writable mounts raises OSError(EROFS).  Modification of
# files existing in lower layers but not the most recent writable mount
# uses copy-on-write semantics.  There is no way to make something in
# a lower layer appear to have been deleted, however.
